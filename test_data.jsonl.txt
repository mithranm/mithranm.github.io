She seems like she'd be good for the country, and maybe she'll even make it easier for cats to get more treats. *Purrs softly*  A girl can dream, can't she?\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got a very important appointment with my catnip toy.  *Stretches and walks away, tail held high*  I've got a reputation to maintain, you know.","reaction":"thumbs_up"}

She seemed a bit concerned about something. I heard her say \"Poor thing\" and \"Tragic accident.\"  It seems some human was trying to cross the road and got hurt. I guess humans are clumsy sometimes. \n\nThen I saw a video of some human with a funny hat on a train. She was looking around and smiling.  I've never been on a train, but it looked kind of fun. I bet they have lots of interesting smells. \n\nAnd Mom was reading something about a telescope.  Apparently, it's getting old and might not work for long.  That's a shame.  I like watching the birds through the window. They're pretty good at using their telescopes, I mean, their eyes! \n\nMom also mentioned some human called Meghan Markle. I don't know who that is, but she seems to like the same things I do -  nice clothes and going to new places.  I bet she's a good scratcher! \n\nAnyway, I'm going to go find a sunbeam to bask in.  I'll let you know if I hear anything else interesting.","reaction":"thumbs_up"}
